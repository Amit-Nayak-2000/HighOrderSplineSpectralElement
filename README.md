# High Order Spline Spectral Element

By: Amit Nayak & Dr. David A Kopriva


This code in this repository outputs a mapped polynomial representation (chebyshev) for data evaluated using high order splines. 
The user provides accurate x & y data, and can specify their polynomial and or spline order.
The main function to be used is ChebySpline. An sample run can be seen in samplerun.m using the NACA0012 airfoil.
